# Lab-A3
This repository contains three programs: Math Fun, Roach Population Simulation, and Coins. The Math Fun lab performs various mathematical computations, the Roach Population Simulation simulates the growth of a roach population, and the Coins program calculates the most efficient method of reaching a dollar value (i.e most efficient way to get 35 cents is to have 1 quarter and 1 dime).
